                Hi, I’m Juan Carlo Dela Cruz, a BSIT student from 2N at Quezon City University. I’m working hard to finish my studies and achieve my dream of becoming successful someday.

I enjoy learning about technology and discovering how it can solve problems and improve people’s lives. Being a student in the IT field has been both challenging and rewarding, and it motivates me to keep growing and improving.

Aside from my studies, I like to spend time learning new skills and exploring ways to better myself. I believe that all the hard work I put in now will help me build a bright future.

I look forward to the day when I can use everything I’ve learned to make a difference and achieve the life I’ve always dreamed of. For now, I’m focused on giving my best every step of the way.

                            Artists focus on creating visually appealing sprites, backgrounds,

                            Pixel art is also known for its limited color palettes and techniques like dithering, 
                            which help to create texture and depth despite the limited resolution.

                            refers to the creative process of developing the rules, mechanics, and narrative that make up a game. 
                            It involves designing gameplay systems, player objectives, and how the game world operates, ensuring that 
                            the game is engaging, challenging, and fun. Game designers collaborate with artists, programmers, and sound 
                                designers to bring their vision to life, paying attention to player feedback and refining mechanics

                            At its core, game design requires a deep understanding of the target audience and the type of experience 
                            the game intends to provide. The designer must consider how to keep players motivated, the pacing of the game, 
                            and how various elements like character abilities, environmental factors, and storyline all come together 
                            to create a cohesive experience. Whether it’s an action-packed shooter, a strategy game, or a narrative-driven RPG, 
                            the goal is to create a balance between challenge and reward, ensuring the game remains engaging throughout its duration.

                            is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, 
                            rather than functions or logic. In OOP, objects represent both data and 
                            methods that can manipulate that data, which allows for modular, reusable, 
                            and maintainable code. This approach is especially beneficial for game development, 
                            where multiple objects (such as characters, enemies, and items) need to interact in complex ways.

                        <p class="small-para">
                            In OOP, key principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction help to 
                            streamline code organization and problem-solving. Inheritance allows new classes to inherit properties 
                            and behaviors from existing ones, promoting code reuse

                            are software systems used to manage and organize data, allowing users to store, modify, 
                            and retrieve data efficiently. In a DBMS, data is organized into tables, and SQL 
                            (Structured Query Language) is commonly used to query and manage the database

                        <p class="small-para">
                            DBMS provides essential features like data integrity, security, and backup management, 
                            ensuring that information is easily accessible, consistent, and protected from corruption. 
                            In the context of game development, DBMS can be used to manage game data, such as player progress, 
                            inventory, or leaderboards, ensuring that important data is stored reliably and can be accessed by 
                            multiple players or systems.
